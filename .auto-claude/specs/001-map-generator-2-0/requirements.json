  "task_description": "We need to improve the map generation to make it always the outside be one deep water tile, to match the empty of the map viewers, them, a shallow water because always will be a shallow water between deep water and terrain, then we have at least one tile of sand, we can have some beachs, but other places for the outside will need at least one tile. For water inside the map, we need to keep the same pattern, always a shallow water betwen deep water, but we dont need sand between them.  You can research web for good algorithms and good patterns to generate maps, even dwarf fortress as our biggest muse.\nOur main goal is to have the most green map with good water spots for the animals drink, but not too much, so we need to make it very configurable, make it already all number based so we can regenerate easily new ones and see the results. Factorio is a good map generator example too. Even OpenRCT2. We dont want rocks now, just trees, and mountains will be only by heights, but still grass and forest. Remember our animals species that we will populate the maps, the focus is to create a good habitat for them. We need a good sized map, so we can have a very good number of animals living without colliding. Take note that we need foraging bushes and fruits that we already had some time ago. Remember to take a snapshot of the current good running status of right now, we need to implement all this and in the end, have the same good running status again, ok? Ultrathink and use agents to speed things up",

For water inside the map, we need to keep the same pattern, always a shallow water betwen deep water, but we dont need sand between them.  You can research web for good algorithms and good patterns to generate maps, even dwarf fortress as our biggest muse.\\nOur main goal is to have the most green map with good water spots for the animals drink, but not too much, so we need to make it very configurable, make it already all number based so we can regenerate easily new ones and see the results. Factorio is a good map generator example too. Even OpenRCT2. We dont want rocks now, just trees, and mountains will be only by heights, but still grass and forest. Remember our animals species that we will populate the maps, the focus is to create a good habitat for them. We need a good sized map, so we can have a very good number of animals living without colliding. Take note that we need foraging bushes and fruits that we already had some time ago. Remember to take a snapshot of the current good running status of right now, we need to implement all this and in the end, have the same good running status again, ok?

This is an INTERNAL ALGORITHM task, NOT an external integration task\n2. All required dependencies are already in place (noise, rand, rand_pcg)\n3. OpenRCT2-style terrain generation is already implemented in world_generator.rs\n4. The project has extensive configurable parameters via OpenRCT2TerrainConfig\n5. References to DF/Factorio/OpenRCT2 are for algorithm inspiration, not libraries\n\nExisting Infrastructure:\n- src/tilemap/world_generator.rs - Main terrain generation (1700+ lines)\n- src/tilemap/terrain.rs - 12 terrain types with properties\n- src/tilemap/openrct2/ - Simplex noise and height map modules\n- src/map_generator.rs - CLI tool for map generation\n\nAlgorithm Patterns Documented:\n- Dwarf Fortress: Fractal terrain, multi-factor biomes, rejection sampling\n- Factorio: Spot noise for controlled feature placement, chunk-based generation\n- OpenRCT2: Height thresholds, 3-phase smoothing, slope calculation\n\nRecommendations:\n1. [HIGH] Extend OpenRCT2TerrainConfig with perimeter handling parameters\n2. [HIGH] Implement distance-from-edge calculation for forced perimeter terrain\n3. [MEDIUM] Consider spot noise for strategic water placement (Factorio pattern)\n4. [MEDIUM] Add moisture layer for richer biomes (Dwarf Fortress pattern)\n5. [LOW] Create snapshot before changes (user requested)\n\nresearch.json created successfully.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**No external library integrations are needed.** The task is about improving internal map generation algorithms.\n\nThe project already has:\n- **`noise = \"0.9\"`** - Full procedural noise library (Perlin, Simplex, fBm)\n- **`rand/rand_pcg`** - Deterministic seeded random generation  \n- **OpenRCT2-style generation** - Already implemented in `world_generator.rs`\n\nThe requirements reference **Dwarf Fortress**, **Factorio**, and **OpenRCT2** as **algorithm design inspiration**, not as libraries to integrate. I've documented the key patterns from each:\n\n| Game | Key Pattern for This Project |\n|------|------------------------------|\n| Dwarf Fortress | Multi-factor terrain (elevation + moisture + temperature), fractal subdivision |\n| Factorio | \"Spot noise\" for controlled resource/feature placement, chunk-based generation |\n| OpenRCT2 | Height thresholds for terrain types, iterative smoothing (already implemented!) |\n\nSources:\n- [Rust noise crate documentation](https://docs.rs/noise)\n- [noise-rs GitHub](https://github.com/Razaekel/noise-rs)\n- [Dwarf Fortress World Generation Wiki](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:World_generation)\n- [Dwarf Fortress Advanced World Generation](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Advanced_world_generation)\n- [Factorio Friday Facts #390 - Noise Expressions 2.0](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-390)\n- [Factorio Friday Facts #112 - Better Noise](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-112)\n- [OpenRCT2 Map Generation Wiki](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Map-Generation)",

The primary goals are: (1) enforce consistent boundary rules with deep water perimeter → shallow water → sand coastline, (2) implement proper internal water body transitions, (3) maximize grass/forest coverage while providing adequate drinking water spots, and (4) make all generation parameters fully configurable for easy iteration.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a significant feature implementation that enhances an existing system (OpenRCT2-style terrain generation) with new boundary rules, improved biome distribution, and resource placement. It requires coordinated changes across multiple files while maintaining backward compatibility with existing simulation systems.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **main** (primary) - Rust simulation engine containing all map generation code\n    17→\n    18→### This Task Will:\n    19→- [ ] Implement perimeter boundary rules: 1 tile deep water → shallow water layer → minimum 1 tile sand\n    20→- [ ] Implement internal water body transition rules: deep water → shallow water (no sand required)\n    21→- [ ] Add configurable parameters for all terrain thresholds and ratios\n    22→- [ ] Maximize grass/forest terrain coverage as primary land type\n    23→- [ ] Implement strategic water spot placement using spot noise algorithm (Factorio-inspired)\n    24→- [ ] Add moisture and temperature layers for multi-factor biome determination (Dwarf Fortress-inspired)\n    25→- [ ] Re-implement foraging bushes and fruit resources in the resource layer\n    26→- [ ] Optimize map size parameters for animal population density\n    27→- [ ] Add map validation/rejection system to ensure quality constraints are met\n    28→\n    29→###

[SEVERITY: HIGH] Missing snapshot/backup requirement from user\n   - Requirements say: \"Remember to take a snapshot of the current good running status\"\n   - Research recommends: \"Create snapshot/backup mechanism before changes\"\n   - Spec: No mention of creating a backup/snapshot before implementation\n   - Location: Task Scope and Implementation Notes sections\n\n2. [SEVERITY: MEDIUM] Incomplete code example in Multi-Octave Noise Pattern\n   - Spec shows: detail_x, detail_y used but never defined\n   - Actual code in biome.rs: Includes `let detail_x = x as f64 * detail_scale;`\n   - Location: Lines 121-122\n\n3. [SEVERITY: MEDIUM] Map generator file ambiguity\n   - Spec mentions: `src/bin/map_generator.rs` only\n   - Project has TWO: `src/bin/map_generator.rs` (simple) AND `src/map_generator.rs` (clap-based)\n   - Research references: `src/map_generator.rs`\n   - Location: Files to Modify table, line 63\n\n4. [SEVERITY: LOW] BiomeGenerator already has moisture/temperature layers\n   - Spec says: \"Enhance BiomeGenerator with moisture/temperature layers\"\n   - Reality: These already exist in src/tilemap/biome.rs (lines 168-199)\n   - Location: Line 62, Files to Modify table\n\n5. [SEVERITY: LOW] Pattern section implies new code, but pattern exists\n   - Spec shows multi-octave noise as \"pattern to follow\"\n   - Reality: This exact code already exists in BiomeGenerator\n   - Location: Lines 109-127\n```\n\n## PHASE 3: FIX ISSUES",

The primary goals are: (1) enforce consistent boundary rules with deep water perimeter → shallow water → sand coastline, (2) implement proper internal water body transitions, (3) maximize grass/forest coverage while providing adequate drinking water spots, and (4) make all generation parameters fully configurable for easy iteration.\n\n## Workflow Type\n\n**Type**: feature\n\n**Rationale**: This is a significant feature implementation that enhances an existing system (OpenRCT2-style terrain generation) with new boundary rules, improved biome distribution, and resource placement. It requires coordinated changes across multiple files while maintaining backward compatibility with existing simulation systems.\n\n## Task Scope\n\n### Services Involved\n- **main** (primary) - Rust simulation engine containing all map generation code\n\n### This Task Will:\n- [ ] **Create snapshot** of current working state (git tag or backup) before any changes\n- [ ] Implement perimeter boundary rules: 1 tile deep water → shallow water layer → minimum 1 tile sand\n- [ ] Implement internal water body transition rules: deep water → shallow water (no sand required)\n- [ ] Add configurable parameters for all terrain thresholds and ratios\n- [ ] Maximize grass/forest terrain coverage as primary land type\n- [ ] Implement strategic water spot placement using spot noise algorithm (Factorio-inspired)\n- [ ] Extend BiomeGenerator usage for improved biome determination (moisture/temperature layers already exist)\n- [ ] Re-implement foraging bushes and fruit resources in the resource layer\n- [ ] Optimize map size parameters for animal population density\n- [ ] Add map validation/rejection system to ensure quality constraints are met\n\n### Out of Scope:\n- Rock terrain types (explicitly excluded per requirements)\n- New animal species or AI behavior changes\n- Viewer modifications (Godot/Web)\n- Performance optimizations beyond current system\n\n## Service Context\n\n### Main Service\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Language: Rust\n- Framework: Bevy ECS\n- Key directories: `src/tilemap/`, `src/vegetation/`, `src/bin/`\n\n**Entry Point:** `src/main.rs`\n\n**How to Run:**\n```bash\ncargo run --release --bin life-simulator\n# Or for map generation only:\ncargo run --bin map_generator generate my_world \"World Name\" 12345\n```\n\n**Port:** 54321 (HTTP API)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Service | What to Change |\n|------|---------|---------------|\n| `src/tilemap/world_generator.rs` | main | Add boundary enforcement, spot noise water placement, integrate existing BiomeGenerator for multi-factor terrain |",

For water inside the map, we need to keep the same pattern, always a shallow water betwen deep water, but we dont need sand between them.  You can research web for good algorithms and good patterns to generate maps, even dwarf fortress as our biggest muse.\\nOur main goal is to have the most green map with good water spots for the animals drink, but not too much, so we need to make it very configurable, make it already all number based so we can regenerate easily new ones and see the results. Factorio is a good map generator example too. Even OpenRCT2. We dont want rocks now, just trees, and mountains will be only by heights, but still grass and forest. Remember our animals species that we will populate the maps, the focus is to create a good habitat for them. We need a good sized map, so we can have a very good number of animals living without colliding. Take note that we need foraging bushes and fruits that we already had some time ago. Remember to take a snapshot of the current good running status of right now, we need to implement all this and in the end, have the same good running status again, ok?

Chunk-based generation with 16x16 tiles per chunk\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `src/tilemap/world_generator.rs` - 1700+ lines, main terrain generation\n- `src/tilemap/openrct2/settings.rs` - Configuration pattern\n- `src/tilemap/biome.rs` - BiomeGenerator with noise layers\n- `src/resources/generator.rs` - Resource placement logic\n\nNow I'll create the complete implementation plan:",

A coder agent will handle the actual implementation.**",

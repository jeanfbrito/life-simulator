=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Map Generator 2.0 - Enhanced Terrain Generation
Workspace: /Users/jean/Github/life-simulator
Started: 2026-01-03

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a significant feature implementation that enhances an existing system
(OpenRCT2-style terrain generation) with new boundary rules, improved biome distribution,
and strategic water placement. Maintains backward compatibility with existing simulation.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Analyzed existing patterns in world_generator.rs (1700+ lines)
- Identified BiomeGenerator already has moisture/temperature/elevation
- Found foraging resources already implemented (BerryBush, HazelShrub, etc.)
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 10
- Total subtasks: 23
- Created init.sh

=== SERVICES INVOLVED ===

- main (Rust simulation engine)
  - Primary modification target: src/tilemap/world_generator.rs
  - Configuration: src/tilemap/openrct2/settings.rs
  - Biome: src/tilemap/biome.rs
  - CLI: src/bin/map_generator.rs
  - Resources: src/resources/generator.rs

=== PARALLELISM ANALYSIS ===

Max parallel phases: 3
Recommended workers: 1 (sequential due to shared world_generator.rs)

Parallel groups:
- phase-4-spot-noise + phase-5-biome-integration (work on different aspects)
- phase-7-cli + phase-8-resources (work on different files)

=== KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED ===

1. OpenRCT2TerrainConfig pattern:
   - Cascading height thresholds (35 → 60 → 65 → 120 → 160)
   - Frequency + threshold pairs for feature density
   - All parameters numeric for easy tuning

2. Multi-phase generation:
   - Phase 1: generate_all_initial_heights()
   - Phase 2: smooth_whole_map()
   - Phase 3: finalize_chunk_from_whole_map() ← Apply boundary rules HERE

3. BiomeGenerator already has:
   - get_moisture(x, y) → 0.0-1.0
   - get_temperature(x, y) → 0.0-1.0
   - get_elevation(x, y) → 0.0-1.0
   - Multi-octave noise (primary + detail layers)

4. ResourceGenerator already has:
   - BerryBush, HazelShrub (HerbivoreBrowse)
   - MushroomPatch, WildRoot (HumanGather)
   - Biome-aware placement via BiomeResourceMultipliers

=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===

✓ Perimeter: Deep water → Shallow water → Sand (minimum 1 tile each)
✓ Internal: Deep water → Shallow water → Land (no sand required)
✓ Land coverage: ≥ 60% of total map
✓ Grass + Forest: ≥ 50% of land tiles
✓ Water spots: Distributed across all quadrants
✓ Foraging resources: Spawn on walkable terrain
✓ All parameters: Numeric and configurable
✓ Validation: Reject invalid maps, retry with modified seed

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/jean/Github/life-simulator

  # First, create the safety snapshot:
  git tag -a pre-mapgen2.0 -m "Snapshot before Map Generator 2.0 implementation"

  # Then start implementation:
  # (Coder agent will pick up from phase-1-setup)

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: HIGH
Skip Validation: NO
Test Types Required: unit, integration, e2e

Acceptance Criteria:
- All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- New boundary enforcement tests pass
- Terrain distribution meets targets
- Map generates without errors
- Animals spawn and move correctly
- System stability matches pre-implementation

=== END SESSION 1 (PLANNER) ===

[2026-01-03 - subtask-2-3] Integrate new config structs into WorldGenerator
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

Changes made:
1. Added imports for MapGen2Config and SpotNoiseConfig from super::openrct2
2. Added mapgen2_config: MapGen2Config field to WorldGenerator struct
3. Added spot_noise_config: SpotNoiseConfig field to WorldGenerator struct
4. Initialized both fields with default values in new() constructor
5. Added with_mapgen2_config() builder method
6. Added with_spot_noise_config() builder method

Pattern followed:
- Followed exact same pattern as existing openrct2_config integration
- Used builder pattern for configuration flexibility
- All new config structs properly initialized with Default trait

Files modified:
- src/tilemap/world_generator.rs

Verification:
- Code follows established patterns
- Imports are correct
- All fields initialized in constructor
- Builder methods match existing style

Next steps:
- Phase 3: Boundary Enforcement (subtask-3-1, 3-2, 3-3)
- These new config structs will be used to control boundary rules and water placement


[2026-01-03 - subtask-4-1] Implement spot noise water placement algorithm (Factorio-inspired)
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

Implementation:
1. Added generate_water_spots() method to WorldGenerator
2. Uses multi-octave Simplex noise for natural water spot distribution
3. Follows pattern from biome.rs for noise generation and normalization
4. Applies radial falloff for circular water bodies
5. Configurable via SpotNoiseConfig (frequency, threshold, radius_scale)
6. Lowers terrain heights at water spot locations before smoothing

Algorithm details:
- Primary noise layer (large scale) + detail layer (small scale variation)
- Combines layers with weighted averaging (0.7 primary + 0.3 detail)
- Normalizes to 0..1 range using pattern from biome.rs
- Threshold filtering identifies water spot centers
- Spot radius calculated from noise strength and config parameters
- Radial falloff: interpolates between current height and water height
- Only modifies tiles above water level (preserves existing terrain)

Key features:
- Even distribution across map via noise frequency
- Natural clustering via threshold parameter
- Configurable spot density and size
- Smooth integration with terrain (pre-smoothing application)

Files modified:
- src/tilemap/world_generator.rs (added 95 lines)

Verification:
✓ Function exists: grep -c 'generate_water_spots' returns 1 (expected)
✓ Follows biome.rs noise pattern exactly
✓ Uses SpotNoiseConfig and MapGen2Config parameters
✓ Proper bounds checking for map edges
✓ Git commit created successfully

Next steps:
- subtask-4-2: Integrate water spots into height generation pipeline
- Call generate_water_spots() in generate_all_initial_heights before smoothing


[2026-01-03 - subtask-5-2] Use moisture/temperature from BiomeGenerator in terrain determination
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

Implementation:
1. Modified generate_terrain_from_height() to use BiomeGenerator climate data
2. Replaced simple height-threshold + noise approach with comprehensive biome-based system
3. Now uses multi-factor terrain selection based on moisture, temperature, and elevation

Changes made:
- Get moisture from biome_generator.get_moisture(world_x, world_y)
- Get temperature from biome_generator.get_temperature(world_x, world_y)
- Normalize height (0-255) to elevation (0.0-1.0) to match BiomeType expectations
- Determine biome using BiomeType::from_climate(temperature, moisture, elevation)
- Use biome.select_terrain(random_value) for natural terrain variety within biome
- Convert TerrainType to String for return value

Key improvements:
- Terrain now reflects climate conditions (moisture + temperature)
- Natural biome boundaries instead of arbitrary noise thresholds
- Consistent with BiomeGenerator's multi-octave noise patterns
- Eliminates hardcoded desert/forest thresholds
- Uses biome-specific terrain distributions from biome.rs

Files modified:
- src/tilemap/world_generator.rs (generate_terrain_from_height method)

Verification:
✓ grep -c 'biome_generator.get_moisture' returns 1 (expected)
✓ Function now integrates BiomeGenerator properly
✓ Follows pattern from biome.rs (BiomeType::from_climate)
✓ Git commit created successfully

Next steps:
- subtask-5-3: Maximize grass/forest coverage by adjusting thresholds

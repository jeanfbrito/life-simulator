TPS:           10.0 (100% stable across 38 measurements)
Tick Times:    5.1-5.5ms range, 5.2ms average
Baseline:      4.8-5.3ms acceptable range
Regression:    None detected (0.0% performance impact)

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
--------------------
✅ TPS sustained at 10.0 over 250+ ticks
✅ Average tick times ~5ms (4.8-5.5ms acceptable)
✅ No performance regression from baseline
✅ 10 TPS constraint maintained (not exceeded)

KEY METRICS AT TICK INTERVALS:

   - Mouse wheel zoom with smooth interpolation
   - Middle mouse drag panning
   - Edge scrolling
   - Keyboard movement (Arrow keys + WASD)
   - Zoom limits (0.2x - 5.0x)

2. **Advanced Entity System** (66% vs 16%)
   - Juvenile scaling for realistic age representation
   - Action labels showing current behaviors
   - 200ms polling frequency
   - Species-specific rendering

3. **Professional UI Overlays** (80% vs 80%)
   - Real-time statistics HUD
   - Controls overlay with toggle functionality
   - BBCode formatting support
   - Performance monitoring (FPS, Memory)

4. **Native Performance**
   - Compiled engine performance
   - ECS-based architecture
   - Manual memory management
   - TileMap rendering system

#### 🌐 Web Viewer Strengths
1. **Universal Accessibility**
   - No installation required
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Browser-based deployment
   - Lightweight distribution

2. **Resource Rendering** (60% vs 40%)
   - 4 resource types with emoji support
   - Layer-based rendering system
   - Chunk integration

3. **Modern Web Architecture**
   - Modular JavaScript system
   - API-based communication
   - Event-driven design
   - RESTful backend integration

## Detailed Analysis

### Terrain Rendering
- **Godot**: Uses TileMap system with isometric projection, proper tileset support, and caching optimizations
- **Web**: Canvas-based rendering with chunk loading, but lacks isometric projection and color mapping

### Resource Rendering  
- **Godot**: Emoji-based rendering with Y-sorting for depth, but integration needs improvement
- **Web**: Better chunk integration and more resource types currently implemented

### Entity Rendering
- **Godot**: Superior with juvenile scaling, action labels, and proper polling system
- **Web**: Basic entity rendering without advanced features

### Camera Controls
- **Godot**: Comprehensive control system with all input methods supported
- **Web**: Basic drag-to-pan with limited zoom functionality

### UI Overlays
- **Both**: Have controls overlay, but Godot adds real-time statistics
- **Godot**: Professional theming and BBCode formatting
- **Web**: HTML-based formatting with simpler design

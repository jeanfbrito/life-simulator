## Usage in Godot

These sprites replace the temporary stronghold textures previously used.

    "Wood": preload("res://assets/sprites/vegetation/trees/tree_pine.png"),
    "WoodDeciduous": preload("res://assets/sprites/vegetation/trees/tree_deciduous.png"),
}
```

**Rendering:**
- Position using isometric tile coordinates (map_to_local)

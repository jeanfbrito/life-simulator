# RCT2 Sprites Quick Reference Guide

**Quick answers to common questions about RCT2 sprite extraction.**

---

## ‚ùì Are 11 Trees Enough?

### ‚úÖ YES! 11 Grass Trees is EXCELLENT Variety

You currently have:
- **4 Fir varieties** (different shapes and colors)
- **4 Pine varieties** (including the iconic Scots Pine)
- **2 Deciduous trees** (round and layered)
- **1 Majestic cedar** (landmark tree)

**This gives you plenty of visual variety for forests!**

### When to Extract More Trees

**Extract desert trees** (4 varieties) if you need:
- Palm trees for oasis scenes
- Cypress for Mediterranean
- Willow for rivers/lakes

**Extract snow trees** (5 varieties) if you need:
- Winter/snowy biomes
- Christmas themed content

**Extract large trees** (10+ varieties) if you need:
- Landmark trees (4√ó4 Giant Mangrove)
- Jungle/tropical forests (3√ó3 tiles)
- More detailed multi-tile trees

**Bottom line**: Start with your 11 grass trees. Add more later if needed!

## üìö How to Search for Sprites Instead of Manual Hunting

### ‚úÖ Use the Index Files!

I created three index files to help you:

#### 1. **RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md** (This Directory)
- **Complete tree catalog** with 35+ varieties
- Searchable by category, name, status
- Includes DAT filenames, object IDs, extraction status
- **Use**: Search (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F) for tree names, categories

**Example Searches**:
```
"Desert Trees"        ‚Üí Find all desert trees
"‚úÖ EXTRACTED"         ‚Üí See what you already have
"Not extracted"       ‚Üí See what's available
"Palm"                ‚Üí Find palm tree varieties
"Large Trees"         ‚Üí Multi-tile trees
```

#### 2. **RCT2_OBJECT_INDEX.txt** (This Directory)
- **Full RCT2 object catalog** (started with 50 objects)
- Format: `FILENAME | OBJECT_ID | TYPE | NAME | PROPERTIES`
- Can be expanded to all 2,119 objects
- **Use**: Search for any RCT2 object by name or type

#### 3. **GRASS_TREES_COMPLETE.md** (This Directory)
- **Detailed info on the 11 extracted grass trees**
- File sizes, visual characteristics, usage examples
- Weighted random selection code
- Biome recommendations

## üîç How to Find Specific Sprites

### Method 1: Use the Trees Index (Fastest)
```bash
# Open the index
open godot-viewer/assets/sprites/vegetation/trees/RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md

# Search for what you want (Cmd+F / Ctrl+F)
# Example: Search for "Palm" to find palm trees
# You'll get: TOAS.DAT | Oasis Palm Tree
```

### Method 2: Search OpenRCT2 Source Code
```bash
# Search for object references
grep -r "tree" /Users/jean/Github/OpenRCT2/src/openrct2/world/map_generator/

# Search for specific object types
grep -r "scenery_small" /Users/jean/Github/objects/objects/rct2/
```

### Method 3: List Available DAT Files
```bash
# List all DAT files by pattern
ls "/Users/jean/Downloads/RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Triple Thrill Pack/ObjData/" | grep -i tree

# Or search by prefix
ls "/Users/jean/Downloads/RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Triple Thrill Pack/ObjData/T*.DAT"
```

### Method 4: Check Objects Repository JSON
```bash
# Find objects by ID
find /Users/jean/Github/objects -name "*.json" | xargs grep -l "isTree.*true"

# Search for specific names
grep -r "Palm Tree" /Users/jean/Github/objects/objects/
```

## üìñ Complete Workflow: Finding & Extracting New Sprites

### Example: "I want to extract a palm tree"

**Step 1: Search the index**
```bash
# Open RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md
# Search for "Palm"
# Result: TOAS.DAT | rct2.scenery_small.toas | Oasis Palm Tree
```

**Step 2: Extract the sprite**
```bash
DOTNET="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@6/bin/dotnet"
OBJEXPORT="/Users/jean/Github/objects/tools/objexport/bin/Debug/net6.0/objexport.dll"
OBJDATA="/Users/jean/Downloads/RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Triple Thrill Pack/ObjData"

"$DOTNET" "$OBJEXPORT" "$OBJDATA/TOAS.DAT" ~/Downloads/RCT2-Tree-Sprites/TOAS --png
```

**Step 3: Copy to project**
```bash
cp ~/Downloads/RCT2-Tree-Sprites/TOAS/rct2.toas/images.png \
   godot-viewer/assets/sprites/vegetation/trees/tree_palm_oasis.png
```

**Step 4: Update the index**
- Mark TOAS.DAT as "‚úÖ EXTRACTED" in RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md

## üéØ Most Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: "I need more tree variety"
‚Üí Extract desert trees (4) or large trees (10+)
‚Üí See RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md "Desert Trees" section

### Use Case 2: "I need winter/snow trees"
‚Üí Extract snow trees (5 varieties)
‚Üí See RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md "Snow Trees" section

### Use Case 3: "I want massive landmark trees"
‚Üí Extract large trees (4√ó4 Giant Mangrove, 3√ó3 Jungle trees)
‚Üí See RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md "LARGE TREES" section

### Use Case 4: "I need ground cover / bushes"
‚Üí Extract bush objects
‚Üí See RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md "BUSHES" section

### Use Case 5: "I want to find [specific object]"
1. Search RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md (if it's a tree)
2. Search RCT2_OBJECT_INDEX.txt (for any object)
3. If not found, check OpenRCT2 source code or objects repo

## üöÄ Future Improvements

### To Create Full Searchable Database (Optional)

```bash
# Extract ALL 2,119 objects (takes ~1 hour)
# Then create CSV/JSON database with:
for dat in "$OBJDATA"/*.DAT; do
  # Extract metadata
  # Parse object.json
  # Create database entry
done

# Create searchable index:
# - By object type (ride, scenery, wall, path, etc.)
# - By name (searchable)
# - By properties (isTree, height, flags)
# - By theme (grass, desert, snow, jungle, etc.)
```

**For now, the manual index covers all trees and common objects!**

## ‚úÖ Summary

### Your Question 1: Are 11 trees enough?
**Answer**: YES! You have excellent variety with 11 grass trees. Extract more only if you need specific themes (desert, snow, jungle).

### Your Question 2: Can we create an index to search instead of hunting?
**Answer**: YES! Created three index files:
1. **RCT2_TREES_INDEX.md** - Complete tree catalog (35+ varieties)
2. **RCT2_OBJECT_INDEX.txt** - General object catalog (50+ indexed, expandable to 2,119)
3. **GRASS_TREES_COMPLETE.md** - Detailed info on your 11 extracted trees

**How to use**: Open index file ‚Üí Search (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F) ‚Üí Find DAT filename ‚Üí Extract with command

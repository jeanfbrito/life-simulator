# Web Viewer Modular Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. JavaScript File Serving (Critical)
**Problem**: The web server was trying to serve JavaScript modules from `js/` but the actual files are in `web-viewer/js/`.

**Fix**: Updated `src/web_server_simple.rs` line 217 to prepend `web-viewer` to the path:
```rust
let file_path = format!("web-viewer{}", path);
```

**Result**: JavaScript module files (config.js, renderer.js, etc.) now load correctly with HTTP 200 instead of 404.

---

### 2. Missing Initial Canvas Setup
**Problem**: The modular version never called `setupCanvasSize()` on initialization, leaving the canvas uninitialized.

**Fix**: Added canvas setup in `web-viewer/js/app.js` initialize() method:
```javascript
// Setup initial canvas size
this.renderer.setupCanvasSize(this.controls.getDragOffset());
this.controls.updateZoomDisplay();
```

**Result**: Canvas is now properly sized and zoom display shows correct values on load.

---

### 3. No Initial Render After Data Load
**Problem**: After loading initial chunk data, the viewer never triggered a render, so the map appeared blank.

**Fix**: Added forced initial render in `web-viewer/js/app.js`:
```javascript
// Update stats after loading initial chunks
this.updateStats();
// Force an initial render
this.render();
```

**Result**: Map now displays immediately after data loads.

---

### 4. Dynamic Chunk Loading Not Merging Data
**Problem**: When `loadVisibleChunks()` was called during panning, newly loaded chunks weren't merged back into the main `worldData`, so they wouldn't appear.

**Fix**: Updated `web-viewer/js/chunk-manager.js` to:
1. Accept `worldData` parameter in `loadVisibleChunks()` and `loadVisibleChunksDebounced()`
2. Merge newly loaded chunks into worldData:
```javascript
const newData = await this.requestChunksInArea(centerChunkX, centerChunkY, visibleRadius);

// Merge newly loaded chunks into worldData if provided
if (newData && worldData) {
    this.mergeChunkData(newData, worldData);
}
```

**Result**: Panning now correctly loads and displays new chunks as you move around the map.

---

### 5. Controls Not Passing WorldData
**Problem**: The controls component called chunk loading methods but didn't pass the worldData reference.

**Fix**: Updated `web-viewer/js/controls.js` to pass worldData in drag handlers:
```javascript
if (this.worldData) {
    this.chunkManager.loadVisibleChunksDebounced(this.dragOffset, this.worldData);
}
```

**Result**: Dynamic chunk loading during panning now works correctly.

## Testing

To test the fixed viewer:

1. Start the simulator (if not already running):
```bash
cargo run --bin life-simulator
```

2. Open the viewer:
```bash
open http://127.0.0.1:54321/viewer.html
```

3. Verify:
   - ✅ Map renders with terrain and resources
   - ✅ World info displays (name, seed, chunks)
   - ✅ Stats show correct values
   - ✅ Middle-mouse drag panning works
   - ✅ New chunks load when panning
   - ✅ Zoom controls work
   - ✅ Tooltips display terrain and resource info

## Comparison: Inline vs Modular

The modular version now has the same functionality as the inline version from commit `69b14e3`, with better code organization:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find and fix bugs in isolated modules
- **Reusability**: Components can be imported and used independently
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be unit tested

## Files Modified

1. `src/web_server_simple.rs` - Fixed JavaScript file serving path
2. `web-viewer/js/app.js` - Added initial setup and render calls
3. `web-viewer/js/chunk-manager.js` - Fixed dynamic chunk loading and merging
4. `web-viewer/js/controls.js` - Pass worldData to chunk manager
5. `web-viewer/js/app.js` - Updated render method to pass worldData

All changes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality.

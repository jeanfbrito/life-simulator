## Ecosystem Balance Analysis

### Resource Distribution Analysis
The new resource distribution creates a more natural and engaging ecosystem:

**Visual Improvements:**
- Less crowded appearance (27.5% â†’ 16.9% density)
- More natural resource clustering
- Clearer biome differentiation

**Gameplay Balance:**
- Resources feel valuable but not scarce
- Herbivores have meaningful foraging choices
- Collectables feel like special discoveries

**Species-Specific Adaptations:**
- **Rabbits:** Thrive with abundant grass, occasional shrub browsing
- **Deer:** Benefit from increased shrub availability
- **Raccoons:** Balanced diet supports population growth

### Biome Health Metrics
| Biome | Tree Density | Shrub Density | Collectable Density | Health Score |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Forest | High (12.5%) | Medium (1.8%) | High (1.8%) | âœ… Excellent |
| Plains | Low (1.5%) | Medium (2.3%) | Low (0.5%) | âœ… Good |
| Swamp | Low (1.8%) | Low (0.8%) | Very High (2.4%) | âœ… Excellent |
| Desert | Very Low (0.5%) | Low (1.0%) | Very Low (0.2%) | âœ… Acceptable |

# Shrub and Collectable System - Release Summary

## Overview

This release implements a comprehensive shrub and collectable resource system that expands the ecosystem complexity and provides scaffolding for future gameplay mechanics. The system integrates seamlessly with existing herbivore AI, vegetation growth, and world generation systems.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Expanded Resource Taxonomy ✅
- **New Resource Types**:
  - `BerryBush` - Edible shrub for herbivores (15.0 nutritional value)
  - `HazelShrub` - High-nutrition shrub for herbivores (18.0 nutritional value)
  - `MushroomPatch` - Collectable for human gathering (6.0 nutritional value)
  - `WildRoot` - Rare collectable for human gathering (10.0 nutritional value)

- **Resource Categories**:
  - `Shrub` - For herbivore browsing
  - `Collectable` - For human gathering
  - Enhanced categorization system for behavior differentiation

### 2. Biome-Aware Resource Generation ✅
- **Enhanced Biome System**:

  - Swamp: 3.0x collectable density (excellent mushroom habitat)
  - Plains: 2.0x flower density, 1.5x shrub density (meadow ecosystem)
  - All biomes tuned for realistic resource distribution

- **Terrain-Specific Generation**:
  - Forest terrain: Oak-dominant, increased mushrooms
  - Swamp terrain: Mushroom-heavy, some berry bushes
  - Dirt terrain: More wild roots, fewer rocks
  - Balanced resource placement for natural appearance

### 3. Resource Metadata & Harvest Profiles ✅
- **HarvestProfile System**:
  - `biomass_cap` - Maximum resource size

  - Configurable biomass thresholds
  - Rabbit: 30% grass, 80% shrub preference
  - Deer: 70% grass, 40% shrub preference
  - Raccoon: 60% grass, 80% shrub preference

- **AI Behavior Integration**:
  - Grazing considers shrub availability
  - Diet-aware foraging decisions
  - Nutritional value balancing

### 5. Collectable Harvest Pipeline ✅

## Balancing Changes

### Resource Density Tuning
- **Overall Density**: Reduced from 27.5% to 15.4% per tile
- **Trees**: 8% → 5% (better forest distribution)
- **Berry Bushes**: 3% → 1.5% (more realistic shrub coverage)
- **Hazel Shrubs**: 2% → 1% (balanced with other resources)
- **Mushroom Patches**: 1.5% → 0.8% (maintain rarity)
- **Wild Roots**: 1% → 0.6% (keep as special discovery)
- **Bushes**: 5% → 2.5% (reduce visual clutter)
- **Flowers**: 4% → 2.5% (balanced meadow appearance)

### Nutritional Value Adjustments
- **Berry Bush**: 15.0 → 12.0 (good but not overpowered)
- **Hazel Shrub**: 20.0 → 18.0 (premium food source)
- **Mushroom Patch**: 8.0 → 6.0 (moderate forager food)
- **Wild Root**: 12.0 → 10.0 (good but requires effort)

### Biome Multipliers Refined
- **Forest**: Enhanced tree and mushroom density
- **Swamp**: Major mushroom habitat improvements
- **Plains**: Better meadow flower and shrub balance
- **All Terrain**: Improved natural distribution patterns
